Install : Simply drag and drop LaTeXiT from the image disk into your "Applications" folder, or any other place you want on your hard-drive.\
Uninstall : LaTeXiT creates a folder in ~/Library/Application Support/LaTeXiT of your home folder. If you plan to uninstall LaTeXiT (by dropping its icon in the trash), you might also want to remove this folder.

LaTeXiT is a little utility designed to quickly typeset LaTeX equations and drag'n drop them into other applications. Its included service also allows to type and transform equations directly in most text editors.\
\
It is fair to tell that is is heavily inspired from the remarkable LaTeX Equation Editor by J. McKenzie Alexander. In fact, I missed some features in this application, so I have decided to create a new one. LaTeXiT is not based on Latex Equation Editor, it is simply largely inspired of its basic purpose. However, it is now much more advanced and complete compared to what it was.\
\
Main features of LaTeXiT are :\

\fs22 \cf0 \ulnone In the main text field, type you latex code without bothering with the preamble, the \\begin\{document\} and the \\end\{document\}; they will be added for you. Then, click the "LaTeXise" button and see your image displayed in the image frame. From there, you can save the image, and also drag and drop it in any application that can use it as an illustration. The export format can be set in the preferences. PDF is usually the best choice, since it is a "vectorial" format : the image can be resized without loss of quality. You can also choose the font size and the font color used for image generation.\
Once dropped in another application, a (PDF) equation can still be reopened in LaTeXiT by a simple "Copy/Paste". The LaTeX source code and the parameters of generation have been saved.\
The modes "Display", "Inline" and "Text" match the three LaTeX modes with the same names; please look at a LaTeX documentation to know more about their meaning. The "Eqnarray" mode is a handy shortcut to make multi-lines equations. It automatically uses \\begin\{eqnarray*\}...\\end\{eqnarray*\} around the LaTeX code.\
You can also use LaTeXiT as a service in text editors (or applications that support text editing) to type and transform equations directly in them, by calling LaTeXiT indirectly. See the section \ul Using the "LaTeXiT Service"\ulnone  to get an example.\

The LaTeX preamble required to generate an image (\\documentclass\{...\}, \\usepackage\{...\}, ...) is automatically added. However, you can tune this preamble, just above the main text field, by dragging the handle down. Then you can see it. You can also change this preamble in the Preferences of the application, so that the modifications are kept. You can notice that the first two lines are disabled and cannot be changed; this is because the behaviour of LaTeXiT relies upon these two lines, and you should not have to modify them.\

\fs22 \cf0 \ulnone Since version 2.0.0, LaTeXiT, like with preambles, allows the definition of body templates. These templates are made of two parts : a header and a footer. Thus, you can :\
- have a default content for new documents, made of the concatenation of the header and the footer;\
- enclose an exisiting content with these two parts.\
Like with preambles, you can access quickly the body templates with the small popup button in the upper-left corner of the text area.\

\fs22 \cf0 \ulnone \
Since version 1.16.0, LaTeXiT provides the palette entitled "Additional files".\
You are certainly aware that during a classical, command-line, LaTeX compilation, the engine can use files in the current directory : this can be useful to reference images, non-standard packages (sty) or other resources in your document. Formerly, LaTeXiT did not allow that, since as a user of this graphical interface, you had no access to this "working directory" of the underlying LaTeX engine. It is a temporary folder, the path being subject to changes.\
The palette "Additional files" fixes that. Drop in it files or folders, and LaTeXiT will behave as if they were in its working directory. Technically, this is just a bunch of symbolic links : your files are neither moved, nor copied.\

Since version 2.6.2, LaTeXiT can handle the synchronization of an underlying text file. Either this file has been open with the menu "File > Open\'85 > Text file" (and option "continuously synchronize file content"), or, such a file has been created through "File > Save as\'85" and the same option.\
In both cases:\
-at each  LaTeXization, the file content is updated by the text defining the current equation\
-or if the file is externally modified by another program, LaTeXiT is automatically updated with the new content\
Please note that the synchronization is focused on the file name. If the file is renamed and a new file with the old name is created, then the synchronzation is made with the new file.\
\
Moreover, in "Preferences > Advances > Synchronization additional scripts", custom processes can be defined, either when LaTeXiT saves the underlying file content, or when it detects a new content in that file.\
In those scripts, the variable $INPUTFLE is added in the enviromnent and contains the file name.\

Since version 1.14.0, LaTeXiT handles LaTeX palettes as plugins. Built-in palettes are inside the application, but additional palettes can be installed inside the Library folders, in a sub-folder Application Support/LaTeXiT/Palettes.\
Examples :\
/Library/Application Support/LaTeXiT/Palettes\
/Users/[your name]/Library/Application Support/LaTeXiT/Palettes\
/Network/Library/Application Support/LaTeXiT/Palettes\
\
A palette is a folder with the following structure:\
name.latexpalette\
     |_Info.plist\
     |_Resources\
          |_English.lproj
\fs26 \ul \

The images files must be in the Resources sub-folder.\
The "name" values of the palette and its items can be localized in Localizable.strings files in the sub-folders <lang>.lproj\
A Localizable.strings file is a raw-text UTF-8 file containing lines like "key" = "value", ending with semi-colons.\

(Q)\'a0: where can I get pdflatex, dvipdf and ghostscript ?\
(A)\'a0: please see the section "Install Latex" of this document.\
\
(Q) : I did install LaTeX the way described, but LaTeXiT seems not to be functional either.\
(A) : If you have installed TeXShop, then LaTeXiT, then LaTeX, the paths of LaTeXiT may point to a pdflatexc of TeXShop that is not sufficient. Just try before to remove LaTeXiT's Preferences (~/Library/Preferences/fr.chachatelier.pierre.LaTeXiT.plist). You can also try to set by hand the paths in the "composition" pane of the LaTeXiT's preferences.\
\
\pard\tx280\pardeftab280\pardirnatural\partightenfactor0
\cf0 (Q)\'a0: LaTeXiT does not work under MacOS 10.7 Lion.\
(A)\'a0: LaTeXiT is fully compatible with MacOS 10.7 Lion. But the following scenario may occur\'a0: you might have, a long time ago, configured LaTeXiT to use a PowerPC vesion of the LaTeX engine. ANd Lion does not allow PowerPC code any more. Please check your LaTeX installation, and the paths to pdflatex in the LaTeXiT's preferences ("Composition" pane).\
\
(Q)\'a0: LaTeXiT is crashing at each latexization.";\
(A)\'a0: LaTeXiT is theoretically fully 64 bits compatible. But some buggy 64 bits components of MacOS 10.4, 10.5 and 10.6, are sometimes responsible for those crashes. In the Finder, "Get info"(Command-i) of LaTeXiT and check "Open in 32-bit mode". If it does not solve the problem, send me the crash log.\

(Q): My equation is cut and does not display completely.\
(A): See the "Known issues" section below.\
\
(Q)\'a0: How to set a background color to the equation ?\
(A)\'a0: If you want to set a non-transparent background to your equation, you should consider using a LaTeX command for that. With old versions of ghostscript (<= 8.63), using \\pagecolor\{the color\} was a solution, but it was relying on a bug of bounding-box detection. Other solutions should now be considered, like \\colorbox\{...\}\{...\}.\
\
(Q)\'a0: The service does not work with Keynote.\
(A)\'a0: The service does not work with Keynote 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, since Keynote cannot insert an image into a block of text; as a workaround, you can set in the Preferences, pane "Services", to register service calls in the history. That way, even if the service fails at inserting an image, this one becomes available in the history window, that could have been put in some corner for easy access.\
\
(Q) : The service "Revert equations back to LaTeX code" does not work with Pages'09\
(A) : Unfortunately, Pages'09 totally rewrites the PDFs that are inserted into the text, and strips out the part added by LaTeXiT containing the equation source code... We can only hope that the future version won't keep that behaviour.\
\
(Q)\'a0: Which export format should I prefer ?\
(A)\'a0: PDF is usually the best choice, since it is a "vectorial" format : the image can be resized without loss of quality.\
\
(Q)\'a0: changes to the preamble seems not take effect unless I quit and restart the application.\
(A)\'a0: Any modification to the default preamble does not affect currently open windows, since their would be the risk to overwrite some modifications the user has made in them. However, you do not have to restart the application; just open a new document like in any application (\uc0\u8984 N).\

\fs22 \cf0 \ulnone (Q)\'a0: LinkBack does not work when I use the LaTeXiT's service.\
(A)\'a0: See section "Known issues" for more details. To solve this problem, try to disable the baseline alignment of the equation in the LaTeXiT's service preferences.\
\
(Q)\'a0: I don't understand the "encapsulation" palette.\
(A)\'a0: This palette fills a very particular need. Usually, it is useless to drag'n drop an equation (as an image) towards an application that cannot display images. However, if this application is a LaTeX text editor, it may be relevant to drag'n drop some text related to the equation : its source code, a \\ref\{\} with its title.... So, this is customizable in the palette, and will work for drag'n drop from the library.\
\
(Q)\'a0: How can I use the feynmf package with LaTeXiT ?\
(A)\'a0:  You should use the feynmp package, in "Text" LaTeX mode, using a "latex+dvipdf" composition. Then, a middle-processing script is needed to compute the metafonts of the labels; you should define the following middle-processing script :\
				mpost the-name-of-your-feynmf-graph\
				#but now me must recreate the pdf file\
				latex $\{INPUTTEXFILE\}\
				dvipdf $\{OUTPUTDVIFILE\}\
	Please see the previous section "Using scripts" for enhanced explanations.\

\
(Q)\'a0: How can I use some special fonts for the generated equations ?\
(A)\'a0: I am not an expert in LaTeX fonts, but I have been told a manipulation to do that. You have to use 
\f2\b xelatex
\f1\b0  and tune the 
\f2\b preamble
\f1\b0 .\

- if you only have TeXShop, LaTeXiT cannot function properly. You need a real LaTeX installation. You will find more information in the next section "Install LaTeX";\
- some equations appear cropped on the egdes. This may be a simple illusion, due to the interpolation at the current zoom level; change the zoom level or display the equation at a larger size in another application, and see if this is persistent. If it is, please know that cropping bouding boxes is not that precise in a LaTeX engine : the exactness depends on the engine, the font size, the font size parity, the mode (EQNARRAY, DISPLAY...). I have added many empirical adjustments to be as tight as possible, but it is a pain that the bounding box is so unreliable. Anyway, you can increase the margins (Palettes > Margins) to ensure additional space as needed.\
- when the equation color is set to perfect white, the equation seems ill-cropped (left and right parenthesis may disappear for instance). This is a bug of ghostscript, that fails at cropping well with a white equation on a white background. To fix that, use an "almost white" color, or use the "Palettes > Margins" menu to increase left and right margins;\
- the service does not work with Mail 2.0.0, ..., 3.6 (latest available version at the moment these lines are written);\
- the service does not work with Keynote 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, since Keynote cannot insert an image into a block of text; as a workaround, you can set in the Preferences, pane "Services", to register service calls in the history. That way, even if the service fails at inserting an image, this one becomes available in the history window, that could have been put in some corner for easy access;\
- unfortunately, Pages'09 totally rewrites the PDFs that are inserted into the text, and strips out the part added by LaTeXiT containing the equation source code... So, the service "revert  equations back to LaTeX code" cannot work.\
- LinkBack may not work when using LaTeXiT's service. Indeed, to align the equation with the surrounding text, LaTeXiT embbeds the image in an RTFD stream, so that it can tune the baseline. However, it may happen that text editors fails "extracting" the image from the stream. So, even if the display is correct, LinkBack becomes "unreachable". The culprit in this case is the text editor, but it is something difficult. To solve the problem, disable the "alignement of the equation with the surrounding text" in the LaTeXiT's service preferences; this turns off baseline tuning and do not use RTFD streams;\
- with Pages 1.0.2 and 2.0.1, when using the LaTeXiT service, the automatic shift of the equation, in order to align it on the line ("baseline" management), seems not to work. However, it works well with TextEdit and Nisus Writer Express, so it is certainly a bug of Pages.\
- with EazyDraw 1.7.1, drag'n dropped equations are displayed upside-down. This is a bug of EazyDraw, that has been fixed in the 1.8 version;\
- with Adobe Illustrator, if you drag'n drop a PDF equation from LaTeXiT to Illustrator, the font will be changed, because Illustrator can edit each symbol of the PDF generated by LaTeXiT, and uses its own fonts. To avoid that, use a temporary file: drag the equation from LaTeXiT to your desktop, a file is created, and drop this file into your Illustrator's document. It works, but then you won't be able to edit the equation in Illustrator any more. Other possibility: export with another format (see LaTeXiT Preferences), like EPS, or PDF with outlined fonts;\
- still with Adobe Illustrator, when drag'n dropping in it, a file may be created on the Desktop. It only occurs with Illustrator, and he is mostly responsible, because of its way to handle drag'n drop. Such problems do not occur with OmniGraffle;\
- still with Adobe Illustrator : many glitches reported by users are solved by upgrading Illustrator to a newer version;\
- syntax colouring does not handle "$$" well.\

LaTeXiT relies on a functional LaTeX installation. But if you do not know what LaTeX is, you may find it difficult to find and install it. So, here are some very basis explanations, as guidance if you need it.\
\
\pard\tx560\tx1120\tx1680\tx2240\tx2800\tx3360\tx3920\tx4480\tx5040\tx5600\tx6160\tx6720\pardirnatural\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 LaTeX is not really a single program. It is a bunch of executable files and data files that work together. So, like with Linux, you will find LaTeX *distributions*. A distribution of LaTeX is a set of files that somebody gathered and organized so that once installed, it would work.\
\pard\tx560\tx1120\tx1680\tx2240\tx2800\tx3360\tx3920\tx4480\tx5040\tx5600\tx6160\tx6720\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 On MacOS X, there are two well-known distributions : TexLive and MacTeX, the second one embedding the first one.\
- TexLive\
TexLive ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.tug.org/texlive"}}{\fldrslt https://www.tug.org/texlive}}) is a  multi-platform LaTeX distribution.\
- MacTeX\
MacTeX ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://www.tug.org/mactex"}}{\fldrslt https://www.tug.org/mactex}}) is a TeXLive distribution embedding some more apps specific to MacOS X. It is provided through a simple dmg file downloaded on the website (a few hundreds of megabytes, though)\

\pard\tx560\tx1120\tx1680\tx2240\tx2800\tx3360\tx3920\tx4480\tx5040\tx5600\tx6160\tx6720\pardirnatural\qj\partightenfactor0
\cf0 Once such a distribution expanded, LaTeX is installed on your computer. But if you were not warned, you would not even notice that ! In fact, LaTeX has no graphical front-end, the programs are Unix-oriented and can only be called on the command line (using the /Application/Utilities/Terminal)\
However, do not worry : there exists graphical interfaces to use LaTeX in a more user friendly manner. These are third-party software, most of the time free. LaTeXiT is one of them : it allows to typeset  small equations. To write big documents, you would rather use TexShop or iTexMac (for instance), which are designed for that.\
